I uploaded the submission #1 rmd and pdf before the first presentaion but I updated the submission#1 and uploaded it again for the final submission so the time is kind of confusing. But you can see that there is submission#1.pdf uploaded last month.
And there is another repository called submission#2 which I also uploaded before the second presenation and changed it to public for the final project.
